This worker script can send logs from Cloudflare to Axiom.

## Quickstart

Copy the contents of `src/worker.js` into a new worker on cloudflare

Update the authentication variables to corresponding dataset and token:
```ts
const axiomDataset = "my-dataset" // Your Axiom dataset
const axiomToken = "xapt-xxx" // Your Axiom API token
```

Update the log filter variable to only send logs with status code above or equal (default to HTTP code 100):
```ts
const logsHttpMinStatusCode = 100 // Filter logs and send only logs with status code above or equal
```

Add triggers for the worker, e.g a route trigger:
  - Navigate to the worker and click on the `Triggers` tab.
  - Scroll down to Routes and click `Add Route`.
  - Enter a route, e.g `*.example.com` and choose the related zone, 
    then click `Save`.

When requests are made to the routes you setup, the worker will be triggered and you will see the logs delivered to your Axiom dataset.
